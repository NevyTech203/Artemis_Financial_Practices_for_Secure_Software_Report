# Artemis_Financial_Practices_for_Secure_Software_Report

1. Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?

The client, Artemis Financial, is a consulting company that handles sensitive information. The client wants to modernize their operations, in doing so we would also need current and effective software security.

2. What did you do very well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing?

Their website uses APIs (Application Program Interface), therefore they would need protection from external threats and leaks. This is imperative due to them being international. When a company is international, they need to abide by the restrictions and laws of their geographic location. This is an urgent matter due to hackers and potential leaks. 

It is important to secure the code due to the desire to protect sensitive information. If a potential client/customer is aware of said companys top notch security, they are going to feel comfortable giving their personal and financial information to do business. This is what helps build credit and trust between the company and client. 


3. What part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?

The part that was helpful was learning the why behind being secure before attempting it... It shows us the important of it so we don't forget it or become careless.


4. How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?

Have multiple steps of security, for instance secure login information or a 2 step authentication process. 


5. How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?

The ways I ensured the code was functional or secure was code in sections and test often.

6. What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?

Something that has helped me since I started in 2020 was online research and reaching out to the academic center for help. 

7. Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?

I would show them my codes... It wouild show my strengths and my level of skill.
